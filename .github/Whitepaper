In the fictional world of Pizzussi, ravens are used as messengers who carry statements of truth. Ravenclassic is a use-case 
focused blockchain designed to carry statements of truth about who owns what currency.

Thank you to the Bitcoin and Ravencoin founder and developers. The Ravenclassic project was launched based
on the hard work and continuous effort of over 430 Bitcoin developers who made over 14,000 commits by the date
of the Ravencoin code fork. We are eternally grateful to you for your diligence in making a secure network and
for your support of free and open source software development. The Ravencoin project is built on the foundation you built.

> **Abstract**. Ravenclassic is a meme cryptocurreny based of the Ravencoin codebase. We, the Ravenclassic team, saw an opertunity in meme cryptocurrenies based off the success of Dogecoin. Them memey-ness comes from the fact that Ravenclassic gets rid of the horrible "ASS"et layer created by Ravencoin. Also, Ravenclassic brings to the table the power of **NEVER**, unless absolutly nessicary, hardforking our codebase. 

## 1. MEME FACTOR
A MEME FACTOR is described as the power of how much memey-ness a coin has. The MEME FACTOR can be rated in the scale of 
1-1,000 MEME POINTS. Ravenclassic aims to have a MEME FACTOR of at least 750 MEME POINTS. MEME POINTS are increased with a 
memey logo, memes created of the coin, and other small features of coins. Sence this is the first-ever use of the MEME FACTOR, 
Ravenclassic has formulated a top three list of the memeyest cryptocurrencies as follows: 

<h3 align="center">
MEME LEADERBOARD
</h3>
<h5>#1 - DOGECOIN - 700 MEME POINTS - CUZ ITZ A DOGE
</h5>
<h5>#2 - BITCONNECT - 690 MEME POINTS - WHEN BITCONNECT BOTTEM LEVEL PONZI SKAM PAY
</h5>
<h5>#3 - RAVENCLASSIC - 500 MEME POINTS - GETS RID OF THE "ASS"ET LAYER. ALSO IS A "CLASSIC" JOKE 
</h5>
Please note these values are subject to change as the MEME POINTS of cryptocurrencies change.

## 2. MEME POINTS
MEME POINTS can be described as "The meme sauce of crypto." HOWEVER, that <i> doesn't </i> mean that making a sause related 
coin will increase your meme factor. To Increase your meme factor to the max you must come up with a memey name, 
minimum of 3 memey features, create memes on a regular basis, and have NO MASTERNODES. Meme points can only be awarded by a
trusted member of the Ravenclassic community or a community approved by Ravenclassic. 

## 3. THE FUTURE OF RAVENCLASSIC
Ravenclassic will continue to build up a strong community and increase our MEME POINTS. In memey-ness we trust. Amen.
